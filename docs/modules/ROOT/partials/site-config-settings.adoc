|===
|*Section* |*Setting* |*Description*
|Listener Configuration |Host Name |Domain name protected by the sensor (for example, www.example.com). It must be unique across all configured sites and cannot contain uppercase letters. Once created, the configured hostname cannot be changed. 
| |SSL/TLS Enabled  |Allows HTTPS connections to the hostname. Use this setting to provide your own site certificate (in PEM format). The setting does not need to be enabled if using {organization} managed certificates with Let’s Encrypt. For more information, see the _Site certificates_ section.
| |SSL/TLS Terminate Only  |If set, SSL/TLS connection is terminated at the sensor and requests are sent through a proxy to the backend using HTTP. 
| |Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS  |If enabled, requests made to the hostname using HTTP receive a 301 response code and are redirected to the same hostname using HTTPS instead.  
| |HTTP2 Enabled |Allows HTTP Version 2 traffic.
| |Wildcard Subdomains Enabled |For example, if enabled for site with “example.com” hostname, site configuration also applies to all requests sent to “subdomain.example.com”.
| | |
|Backend Configuration  |Origin  |Location where traffic can be properly routed to reach your origin server, also called a backend. You can specify a single hostname or CNAME, or a comma-separated list of IP addresses.  +
If you are forwarding traffic to a load balancer, supply the FQDN or IP addresses of your load balancer. The sensor forwards all benign and unblocked traffic to that load balancer. 
| |HTTP Backend Port |Port number of the origin server or load balancer accepting HTTP traffic.
| |HTTPS Backend Port |Port number of the origin server or load balancer accepting HTTPS traffic.
|Blocking Modes |Risk-Based Blocking  +
 + |If set, any entity with accumulated risk above the risk-based blocking threshold https://support.threatx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047689451-IWAF-Settings-Explained[]is blocked. The threshold settings are described in link:#managing-risk-based-blocking[Managing Risk-Based Blocking].
| |Request Blocking  |If set, individual requests that are obvious hostile attacks, as determined by the {organization} rules, are blocked. 
| |Manual Action Blocking  |If set, users can manually add IP addresses to the blocked list and blacklist.
|Caching Configuration   |Static Caching Enabled |Enables static caching. See link:#managing-caching[Managing caching] for details.
| |Dynamic Caching Enabled |Enables dynamic caching. See link:#managing-caching[Managing caching] for details.
| | |
|Proxy Configuration |Maximum Request Body Size |Maximum client request body in MB as read from Content-Length header. Accepts values from 1 to 1,000,000 (1MB to 1TB). Default is 1MB. 
| |Proxy Read Timeout  |Timeout in seconds for reading a response from the backend. Accepts values from 1 to 3,600 (1 second to 1 hour). Default is 90 seconds. 
| |Proxy Send Timeout  |Timeout in seconds for sending a request to the backend. Accepts values from 1 to 3,600 (1 second to 1 hour). Default is 30 seconds. 
| |Set Real IP From Enabled |When checked, client requests override the IP address (as recognized by sensors).  +
*Header Name*. Provides the value for the IP override; for example, “X-Real-IP” or “X-Forwarded-For”. Letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores only. +
*Trusted Sources*. IP addresses of the trusted sources.
| |Custom Response Headers Enabled  |Inserts one or more custom headers into responses, including common security headers such as Content-Security-Policy. Each custom header must have a name and value.
|Access Configuration |Site Groups |You can assign the site to an existing site group, which allows you to limit which users can access the site configuration and its associated data.
