image:getting-started.svg[] {organization} is the future of API and web application security. The {organization} Web Application and API Protection platform provides unmatched protection capabilities while simplifying the work of operational security. With {organization}, you’ll enjoy unparalleled visibility into attacks and external risk to your enterprise.

{organization} uses advanced attacker-centric behavior analysis to identify and block malicious or suspicious traffic, while collecting and prioritizing threat intelligence to protect your APIs and applications from OWASP attacks, bot attacks, DDoS threats, and sophisticated mixed-mode cyberthreats. Our managed service provides round-the-clock protection and access to expert Layer-7 security analysts, to keep APIs and applications secure.

== {organization} Architecture

The {organization} platform is designed to protect applications from the full breadth of Layer 7 security threats, including ...

* Traditional OWASP attacks
* Bots
* Malicious automation
* DDoS 
* API-specific attacks 

Our specialty, however, is *advanced*, *multi-step attacks* where correlation and analysis are required for events often initiated across thousands of IPs.  


.Sensors can also be deployed into public or private cloud and private data centers environments to support specific architectural or compliance requirements.

{organization}’s behavior-based API and application protection platform secures APIs and web applications from cyberthreats across cloud and on-prem environments. We deliver complete protection and deep threat visibility by combining attacker behavior profiling, collective threat intelligence, and advanced analytics. Our managed service combines threat hunting with 24X7 access to the security experts in the {organization} SOC, significantlyreducing the operational overhead and maintenance burdens for enterprises that choose {organization}.

=== *Attacker-Centric Behavioral Analysis*

{organization} uses Attacker-Centric Behavioral Analytics (ACBA). This is an approach that identifies critical elements of an attack, responds to them before any damage is done, and maintains protection even if attackers change or obfuscate their attack pattern to avoid detection. The {organization} platform delivers a range of responsive actions, including blocking, IP interrogation and challenges, and targeted rate limiting or tarpitting. 

Attacker-Centric Behavioral Analytics continuously monitors all users as they interact with an application or API looking for key indicators of suspicious behavior and tracking risk over time and across multiple applications. Combining these indicators helps the system track malicious or suspicious users across many IP addresses as they use various evasion techniques and modify attack parameters. Individual requests may be blocked based on severity, but the approach is designed to limit false positives and identify truly malicious users to be blocked. 

=== *Complete Platform Providing Full-Spectrum Protection* 

{organization} brings together a complementary set of technologies that work together in ways that siloed tools and techniques cannot achieve on their own. Many attackers launch multi-step attacks using multiple IPs in order to evade detection.  By bringing multiple perspectives together in a single context, the {organization} Platform gives security teams a highly accurate, reliable, and complete view of threat activities. 

Specifically, {organization} provides protection often distributed across multiple tools: 

* Web application firewall (WAF) 
* API discovery & compliance  
* API protection 
* Bot management 
* Distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection 
* SaaS and managed security services 

=== *Agentless Deployment*

{organization} provides a new approach to agentless deployment that supports both AppSec and DevOps teams without locking either into architectural decisions or sacrificing their autonomy and flexibility. Our agentless architecture ensures that there is no need to disrupt either your applications or your operations.

== How Can I Install {organization}? 

Purpose-built for the modern application landscape, {organization}’s web stack agnostic, cloud-native, container-based options deploy in minutes and block in hours, combining WAF, DDoS, bot, and API protection capabilities into one solution for all your applications and API endpoints.  

Unlike other sensors such as plugins or source code scanners that need to be installed and upgraded frequently, the {organization} sensor operates a reverse proxy. This means it decrypts traffic between web clients (such as browsers) on your network with APIs/origin servers before re-encrypting them for you – all without any complicated maintenance. The {organization} sensor containers are decoupled from the {organization} Cloud Analytics platform and can be deployed virtually anywhere, delivering global flexibility and enterprise-grade scalability across complex, geographically dispersed application environments.  

The {organization} platform is flexible, adaptive to customer preference, and compliant with a range of customer network and computing infrastructures. Our agentless architecture lets us deploy our sensors into {organization}’s globally hosted cloud environment, a public cloud infrastructure, and servers hosted by our customers in their data centers. We can honestly say “We’ve never met an application or API we can’t protect!” 

=== *Sensor Deployment Options:* 

{organization} offers four simple methods of deployment. 

{organization} Cloud:: {organization} hosts and manages sensor deployment. 
Self-Hosted w/ VM Images:: {organization} provides the customer with a machine image compatible with the customer’s cloud provider and the customer manages the image deployment, cloud hosting parameters, and cloud-specific support.  
Self-Hosted w/ Docker Images:: {organization} provides the customer with a Docker-based {organization} sensor container deployed in the customer’s data center, and the customer manages the container deployment, container and node parameters, and container-specific support.  
{organization} Hybrid Deployment:: Mix of the {organization} cloud, public cloud, and Docker deployments deployed when a single deployment model is not feasible. {organization} will work with the customer to map out the optimal configurations and support models.

== *How Does Blocking Work?* 

{organization}’s blocking modes are designed to block malicious requests and deter suspicious entities from attacking your sites while allowing benign traffic and real users through.  

=== Risk-Based, Request-Based, and Manual Blocking 

There are three different blocking modes available for each site after on-boarding: 

.Blocking Modes
image::ThreatX-Blocking-Modes-1024x310.png[width=1024,height=310]


==== *Request Blocking* 

When enabled for your sites, request blocking will block malicious traffic at the request level when an attack such as SQL injection, XSS, or another malicious request is detected.   

==== *Risk-Based Blocking* 

When enabled, risk-based blocking will allow {organization}’s behavioral analytics engine, hackerMind™, to evaluate each unique entity and block persistently malicious entities based on their behavior over time.  

==== *Manual Action Blocking* 

When enabled, this option permits manual blocking of specific IP addresses. Enabling also permits a {organization} console user (security admin) to add entity IP addresses to the deny list for permanent blocking. 

We recommend leveraging all three blocking modes, but provide users the flexibility to gradually expand blocking levels when on-boarding a new application to help prevent potential false positives or unwanted impacts to your sites.  

== *Free Proof of Concept* 

{organization} offers a free POC where you can work closely with our SOC staff to configure a solution for your API and web application protection needs.

== *What Will I See?* 

=== Best-in-Class Visibility  

{organization} evaluates each request to identify the nature of the request and determine if it is malicious. It is then classified, scored, and passed along to the behavioral analysis engine to process and adjust the entity risk score. The {organization} platform provides visibility into all this historic and live threat activity for your web applications and API endpoints through two dashboards: the Attack Dashboard and API Defender.

=== Attack Dashboard


==== Threat Entities

The {organization} Attack Dashboard visualizes both malicious and benign traffic over time and allows {organization} users to drill down and investigate attacking entities, and the responsive actions the {organization} Platform took to protect their APIs and web applications. The Attack Dashboard is comprised of three main views: Threat Entities, Top Targets, and Threat Map. Each view provides a different perspective on an organization’s attack surface.

.Attack Dashboard, Threat Entities

==== Top Targets

The Attack Dashboard Top Targets view highlights the most frequently targeted sites and endpoints within a tenant. This view is critical for large enterprises with dozens or hundreds of sites protected by the {organization} Platform. This view puts the most frequently and aggressively targeted sites front and center, allowing administrators to understand their risk profile, and the protection they’re receiving from {organization}.

=== API Defender

==== API Observability

The API Defender dashboard provides visibility into endpoints discovered and protected by the {organization} platform. API traffic analytics, error code summaries, and visualizations of API schema conformance are displayed in API Defender, as shown below in Figure 4, providing the ability to compare what API traffic is expected vs. an anomaly against your organization’s API specifications. The API Defender dashboard brings together API discovery, observability, and the context needed to understand your organization’s entire attack surface against what is being seen in the wild.

.API Defender

==== API Discovery

{organization}’s API discovery capabilities analyze and profile legitimate, suspicious, and malicious API use to discover and enumerate the endpoints as well as the traffic they serve. While monitoring API interactions in real-time, {organization} can accurately detect real API endpoints and determine identifying attributes of their tech stacks or markup encodings. 

==== Schema Compliance

Schema Compliance gives users the ability to upload, manage, and cross-compare which API traffic is expected according to your organization’s schema vs. what is being seen in the wild. Manage your organization’s API schemas within the API Defender page to gain risk visibility, simplify schema enforcement, or create API-centered protection rules.
